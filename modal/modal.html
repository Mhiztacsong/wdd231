        <p>Be respectful
            Show empathy and respect towards all community members. We have students from all over the world, of all ages, cultures and backgrounds. Let's learn from each-other, and value the different perspectives we each bring to the table. Make sure your actions, your attitude, and your language on this platform are appropriate and respectful of everyone.
            Keep conversations relevant. To ensure that it's easy for everyone in the community to get the support they're looking for, it's important to keep conversations focused on what's most relevant to everyone using this platform. Be sure to keep conversations focused on learning, avoid spamming conversations with multiple messages, and avoid self-promoting activities. 
            Be safe
            Keep communication on the platform. For everyone's safety, it's essential that you Do Not Share your personal information or contact information (such as full name, city, school, email, phone number, or social media handles) with anyone. 
            Report to the administrator if you have any questions about emails, or if you are receiving messages from a person or persons you do not know. Report if you are receiving messages from recruiters from other organizations that may not be part of BYU Pathway Worldwide. Your safety is my number one concern. 
            *Be kind
            *Look for ways to help! Whether you are a student or a Pathway missionary there are lots of big and little opportunities to support other members in the community—welcoming someone new, show Christlike love to each other. 
            Watch out for the community. If you encounter behavior that makes you or someone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, report it immediately. 
            Your responsibility as a member of the this community is to help make the platform a safe place for everyone to learn. Any behavior that compromises this responsibility, whether it is explicitly mentioned above or not, is grounds for immediate removal of the platform.
